![Boucle Rouge](http://streiten.github.io/sfpc-rtp-vera-molnar/original work/1.png)

This p5 sketch generates an image similiar to the series 'Boucle Rouge' by Vera Molnar.
Click on the canvas to generate a new piece.

The following assumptions were made: 
- the band starts on a random side and follows an overall direction
- each drawing contains a loop somewhat halfway

Improvements  

- reconsider the vertice-generation algorithm and apply more constraints to get better results
- go obejct-oriented
